                <p>
                    Natalie Rose, Founder of Live in Harmony, is responsible for driving forward the company’s ethos for innovation and development. The blend of courses and delivery, coupled with a real understanding of the planet and humanity has proven to be a successful and highly competitive proposition for the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to 2017, Natalie worked as a project manager/designer and has worked for entrepreneurs, start-ups, high profile individuals and worked on various high profile fit-outs in Central London. Natalie started her career as an assistant courier designer for Alexander McQueen and later went onto to style for Dazed & confused and Wallpaper Magazine. She has a Masters in Design & Research and has wrote several research papers on AI, genetics and the future of humanity.

                <p>
                    Over the course of her life, she has become increasingly more concerned about the planet and, humanity. After a trip to the Amazon Jungle doing animal conservation and helping build an eco farm, she returned to the UK and decided to utilise her project management and design skills to deliver a company that works with the planet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Natalie has not only travelled the world extensively but has cycled from London to Paris, raced in Belgium, Italy and the US and partook in the first stage of the Tour de France. She also runs, climbs, horse-rides and participated in the 24-hour ‘Three Peaks Challenge’ for charity.
